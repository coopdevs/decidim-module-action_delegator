              A delegation group is a set of settings to encapsulate the
              configuration of a delegation system. For the moment only consultations are supported.
              <br>
              Each group can be configured with a different number of maximum delegations per user, different
              user delegations grants and different sets of ponderation types.
              <br>
              Delegations are linked to the parent element (currently a consultation) and cannot be edited/deleted after a voting has been started.
