              This module is designed for organizations that do voting through consultations. The functionalities we have available are: compilation of census, delegations of participants and weights by type of member. We can also use the integrated verifier via SMS, email or both. It is possible to use this module without importing a census, you can manage it in order to make delegations and/or weightings. If you need more information, go to guia.cercles.coop.
              <br>
              Each group can be configured with a different number of maximum delegations per user, different user delegations grants and different sets of ponderation types.
